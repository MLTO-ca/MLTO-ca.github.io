Following work at several bitcoin startups, he shifted focus to AI Safety, where he's established numerous community groups. He currently runs Trajectory Labs, a coworking and events space for AI Safety researchers in Toronto, and began collaborating with Myles in 2024 to operate MLTO. Myles Harrison is a data scientist and consultant turned entrepreneur and company principal of PRAKTIKAI. Previously he was the global lead of the Data Science program at a tech bootcamp and designed and taught his own free and pay-what-you-can online curricula in natural language processing and generative AI. He has been deeply involved with the Toronto tech community for over a decade, as a regular speaker at events, the creator and organizer of the Data Drinks networking group, and now as an organizer of MLTO. Our Volunteers We are grateful to our dedicated volunteers who help make MLTO possible: Obinna Onyema is a software developer with a knack for building data infrastructure for analytics and AI use cases. He's worked across banking, digital marketing, and travel, and enjoys solving real-world problems with AI. He's also big on mentoring, process improvement, and community work. Curious, adaptable, and always learning, Obinna's goal is to lead innovation in AI and make a meaningful impact through data. Armen Matoosian is a Toronto-based finance and business professional with a background in capital markets, strategic planning, and financial analysis. With a growing interest in data science and machine learning, he is actively upskilling through projects like the \"100 Days of Code\" and contributing to the local AI community as a volunteer with Machine Learning Toronto (MLTO). Armen brings a multidisciplinary perspective, combining financial expertise with a passion for emerging technologies and community engagement. Bobby Broz is a Senior Associate at a payments startup. His experience in sales, supporting tech customers at scale, and creating analytical solutions makes him versatile, allowing him to work on both the technical and business sides of a company. He enjoys solving real-world problems and building tools that make complex data more actionable. He is passionate about continuous learning, community collaboration, and exploring the impact of emerging technologies. Mimi Yu is a software developer with a focus on frontend development and hands-on experience in full-stack and cloud technologies. She has worked on projects across education, NGOs, and commercial sectors, creating user-friendly digital experiences. A curious lifelong learner, she's now exploring how AI can power meaningful solutions. She joined this organization to support community growth and is always open to collaborating on innovative, AI-driven projects. Maram Jawass is a second-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and web development. Passionate about continuous learning, she actively explores the evolving landscape of technology to stay ahead in the field. She is also a host of TechBiz Talks, a podcast for insightful conversations about tech trends, career tips, and industry perspectives. Maram's goal is to keep expanding her knowledge and contribute meaningfully to the future & safety of technology. Tam Le is an eccentric web developer and aspiring elite vibe coder. Loves to explore and tinker and to make artsy stuff out of code and words. Happy to share and teach what he knows, and to learn as much as he can without going insane. Studying yoga and is obsessed about fitness, nutrition, and ultimately personal and collective wellness. Having traded his brain for brawn, Tam is currently working to restore the balance--to be a good example of a healthy modern caveman working with tech, and to help others along on the path. Neha K is a Senior Product Manager with several years of experience building and commercializing AI-powered B2B SaaS products across cybersecurity, insurance, health-tech and retail-tech. With a technical background in computer science and software engineering, combined with an MBA, she specializes in translating complex AI capabilities into user-friendly products that solve critical business problems. Neha is currently working on independent AI projects and is passionate about advancing machine learning applications. Interested in joining our team?
